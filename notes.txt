I am trying to create an XML parser using C for Lesk
The project is just something simple to fetch information from the an XML file inside the controller
Which will consists in keeping the most information compared to more operational about the speed/functions etc...

Information to retreieve/store
*Product number
*Product name
*OwnerID
*Owner name
*Owner email
*Number of lines (for now we will go to a simple 2*10(*6) lights)
*Data_Pins
*Wifi credential
*Wifi password

To create this parser, I will in order need to make the methods: 
*Read a file --> Done
*Print each character of the file in the terminal --> Done
*Print every tag (no distinction of beginning or end)

Reflexion: 
We have one pointer in the file that holds the place of the first appearance of "<"
We have another one which hold the appearance of ">"
We can then have a structure which has : 
- beginning
- end
- The word


*Print every tag with distinction of beginning and end
*Print the content of a tag



Optional:
*Print the attributes
*Print the content of the attributes
