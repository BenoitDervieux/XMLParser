I am trying to create an XML parser using C for Lesk
The project is just something simple to fetch information from the an XML file inside the controller
Which will consists in keeping the most information compared to more operational about the speed/functions etc...

Information to retreieve/store
*Product number
*Product name
*OwnerID
*Owner name
*Owner email
*Number of lines (for now we will go to a simple 2*10(*6) lights)
*Data_Pins
*Wifi credential
*Wifi password

To create this parser, I will in order need to make the methods: 
*Read a file --> Done
*Print each character of the file in the terminal --> Done
*Print every tag (no distinction of beginning or end) --> Done
*Print every tag even the text --> Done
*Print every tag with distinction of beginning and end --> Done with the function "starts_with"
*Store all the tags in a data structure
*Print the content of a tag


Next:
*Write inside a tag
1 - Let's check how to write inside a file in C
2 - One idea I have here is to store the beginning and the end of a Node so that then we can replace it
in another method as we have no choice than to store the content of a file inside memory


*Replace text inside a tag


Optional:
*Print the attributes
*Print the content of the attributes
*Print the parents node
