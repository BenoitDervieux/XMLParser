I am trying to create an XML parser using C for Lesk
The project is just something simple to fetch information from the an XML file inside the controller
Which will consists in keeping the most information compared to more operational about the speed/functions etc...

Information to retreieve/store
*Product number
*Product name
*OwnerID
*Owner name
*Owner email
*Number of lines (for now we will go to a simple 2*10(*6) lights)
*Data_Pins
*Wifi credential
*Wifi password

To create this parser, I will in order need to make the methods: 
*Read a file --> Done
*Print each character of the file in the terminal --> Done
*Print every tag (no distinction of beginning or end) --> Done
*Print every tag even the text --> Done
*Print every tag with distinction of beginning and end --> Done with the function "starts_with"
*Store all the tags in a data structure
*Print the content of a tag
*Replace the content of a tag using the node name

Next:
Ok so now, we can replace the content of a tag but the problem being that if we don't reactualize 
the list then this can mess up. So I need a function "reload" between every instance of insertion (Or directly inside
the function)


Optional:
*Print the attributes
*Print the content of the attributes
*Print the parents node
*Error for the parsing
